# Building Machine Learning Model Predicting Credit Default

- R / Python

- Pre-processing data

- Change the type of  variables (Ex : One -hot encoding)

- Select the important variables
  - PCA, Lasso, Subset Selection
  
- Using Traditional classification models for prediction
  - Logistic, LDA, KNN, SVM, and Random Forest
  
- Using the other models for prediction
  - XGBoost and LightGBM
  
- Comparing the performance by using the AUC

- Check the Sensitivity to deal with the unbalanced data. (less data on default value) 

- Building Stacking  Model (Image below)
